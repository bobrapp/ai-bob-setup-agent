## 2026-05-13T01:30:00Z — Initial repo build

- **User:** bobrapp
- **Model:** Claude (Opus 4.7 family)
- **Platform:** Hyperagent (Anthropic Claude Agent SDK)
- **Prompt summary:** "Using this YouTube — create a biz plan, step-by-step install guide and all I need to completely automate this process to get to a production — and create a pitch deck, user guide, prd-faq and create an agent called ai-bob-setup-agent for this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI-MNjm1tTQ"
- **Result summary:**
  - Captured the source video metadata and full description (YouTube transcript API was Cloudflare-blocked; description provided rich enough material — full timestamp index, named pricing, named tools, named verticals — to ground every downstream deliverable).
  - Distilled a 12-section spec at `docs/spec.md`.
  - Created public GitHub repo `bobrapp/ai-bob-setup-agent` (MIT, auto-init, Node gitignore template).
  - Built the static documentation site: shared visual system (`assets/style.css`), plus six HTML pages — `index.html`, `bizplan.html`, `pitch.html` (with dual-framing slide deck), `prdfaq.html` (with audience toggle), `userguide.html`, `install.html`.
  - Built the Python automation: `src/` package (`config.py`, `orgo_client.py`, `hermes_install.py`, `mcp_config.py`, `telegram_meta.py`, `observability.py`, `setup_agent.py` CLI), `scripts/` (bootstrap, provision_workspace, provision_agent, healthcheck, watchdog), `install.sh` (one-command idempotent bootstrap), `Makefile` (task runner).
  - Built configuration scaffold: `.env.example` documenting every credential, `config/customers.example.yaml`, `config/stacks/{hermes,openclaw}.yaml`.
  - Built CI/CD: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint + smoke tests + dry-run onboard) and `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` (GitHub Pages deploy).
  - Built tests: `tests/test_smoke.py` — 13 tests, all green locally. Covers config parsing, stack files, pricing invariants from source video, dry-run idempotency, MCP registry completeness, Telegram dry-run, full onboard dry-run end-to-end.
  - Verified the full dry-run onboard path executes cleanly (3-agent acme-marketing test customer onboarded without errors).
  - Initial commit `83c94ac` pushed 38 files atomically via GITHUB_COMMIT_MULTIPLE_FILES.
- **Assets generated:**
  - Repo: https://github.com/bobrapp/ai-bob-setup-agent
  - Pages: https://bobrapp.github.io/ai-bob-setup-agent (deploys on first push to main)
  - HTML pages: `index.html`, `bizplan.html`, `pitch.html`, `prdfaq.html`, `userguide.html`, `install.html`
  - Python package: `src/__init__.py`, `src/config.py`, `src/orgo_client.py`, `src/hermes_install.py`, `src/mcp_config.py`, `src/telegram_meta.py`, `src/observability.py`, `src/setup_agent.py`
  - Scripts: `install.sh`, `Makefile`, `scripts/bootstrap.sh`, `scripts/provision_workspace.py`, `scripts/provision_agent.py`, `scripts/healthcheck.py`, `scripts/watchdog.py`
  - Configs: `.env.example`, `config/customers.example.yaml`, `config/stacks/hermes.yaml`, `config/stacks/openclaw.yaml`
  - Tests: `tests/test_smoke.py`
  - CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
  - Docs: `docs/spec.md`, `docs/source-video.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/build-log.md`
  - Top-level: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`
  - Source video reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI-MNjm1tTQ — "The $1M+ Solo AI Agent Business (Full Course)" by Greg Isenberg with Nick Vasilescu (Orgo)

## 2026-05-13T01:38:00Z — Pages enable + workflow retrigger

- **User:** bobrapp
- **Model:** Claude (Opus 4.7 family)
- **Platform:** Hyperagent
- **Prompt summary:** Continuing initial build — enable GitHub Pages and retrigger deploy.
- **Result summary:** Enabled GitHub Pages with `build_type: workflow` source. First workflow run failed because Pages wasn't enabled yet at push time (race condition). Pushed a small build-log update to retrigger both workflows. Drafted the `ai-bob-setup-agent` named agent for user save through the UI.
- **Assets generated:** Pages site config; named-agent draft `kVrbVUJB`.

## 2026-05-14T22:29:29Z — Phase 0 community-management decision doc

- **User:** bobrapp
- **Model:** Claude (Opus 4.7 family)
- **Platform:** Hyperagent
- **Prompt summary:** Bob and co-founder Ken Johnston (bob.rapp@aigovops.community, ken.johnston@aigovops.community) cannot keep up with running their Circle.so community. Requested an agentic architecture comparable to Marblism / Sintra (or using them) for welcoming, content creation, and bad-behavior monitoring. Approved a phased plan; expanded research scope to include n8n, Zapier AI Actions, and Make.com; chose to extend `ai-bob-setup-agent` rather than open a new repo; assumed Circle.so Business+. Asked for an internal-first decision doc with a public-friendly version to follow.
- **Result summary:** Researched seven candidate architectures (native Hermes/OpenClaw on Orgo, Marblism, Sintra, n8n, Zapier Agents + AI Actions, Make.com, Circle.so native AI Workflows) via six parallel research scouts. Found Circle.so Business is $199/mo (not $299), but outbound webhooks require Circle Plus (custom-priced) and the Business plan caps at 5,000 API requests/month — material constraints for moderation polling. Marblism and Sintra both fail the AIGovOps audit-export requirement. Recommended hybrid path: Circle native AI Workflows for in-platform basics + Make.com Core ($12/mo) for cross-platform orchestration + a thin Hermes-backed Auditor shim writing AIGovOps audit logs in `src/community/audit.py`. All-in target cost: ~$211/mo (mostly Circle). Wrote `community.html` (~800 lines, 11 sections) as an internal decision doc with a 7-way comparison matrix, cost ladder, hard-truths callouts, recommendation, phase plan, open questions for Ken, and source citations. Spliced the `Community` link into the topnav and Docs footer of all 11 existing pages via `splice_nav.py` (idempotent regex; 11/11 nav inserts, 10/11 footer inserts — pitch.html has no footer by design). Phase 0f task queued: rewrite a public-friendly variant after architecture decision lands.
- **Assets generated:**
  - New page: `community.html` (decision doc, 7-way comparison)
  - Modified pages (nav + footer additions): `index.html`, `bizplan.html`, `pitch.html`, `prdfaq.html`, `userguide.html`, `install.html`, `toolstack.html`, `howibuilt.html`, `config.html`, `dashboard.html`, `foundation.html`
  - Branch: `phase-0-community-decision-doc`
  - Pull request: see PR link in commit message
- **Pending approvals:** Ken to confirm Circle plan tier, bot member account name, moderation auto-remove policy, Telegram review channel, webhook-upgrade threshold (see open questions in `community.html`).
